# PongGame 

The C# system.concole is not supported by all platforms, so I have decided that I will create it using the SDL3 libraries whose code has a binding to C# by Alimer.Bindings.SDL

## Todo

# Create Window
using sdl3 libraries to create the window display
# Create BaseGame
# Create Input Handler GamePad and keyboard
# Create game logic Pong
